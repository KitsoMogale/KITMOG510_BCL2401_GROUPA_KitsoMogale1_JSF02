# Svelte + Vite + TailWind

This project aims to refactor a react E-commerce application into a svelte.js project.

The svelte library was installed via npm as vite template.

Tailwind was installed following the instructions in https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/vite.

The project gets data from an api that responds with data that includes individual products and their details.
The products are displayed in a grid display. 
Users can filter products displayed by category, sort them but price magnitude and by searching.
